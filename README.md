## Topics
Labs are based on principles presented in 30 lectures during the semester. Them main topics are: methodology for performance evaluation of RISC computers, microarchitecture of pipelined processors and its efficient programming, performance evaluation of cache memories, design and evaluation of main memory, static scheduling of instructions, out-of-order instruction execution, microarchitecture and evaluation of superscalar processors, VLIW architectures, parallel computing using shared memory architectures, GPUs, multicomputers and application specific instruction set processors.
