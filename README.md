# Computer Architecture hands-on exercises based on the Nios II soft processors
Hands-on exercises for the Computer Architecture course at the [University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (Spain)](https://internacional.ulpgc.es/en/) using Nios II-based software SoCs and DE0-Nano board

[Lab 1. Nios II/e instruction set architecture and programming](labs/lab1/lab1tutorial.pdf)

Lab 2. Performance evaluation of the memory hierarchy of a computer and reverse engineering of the data cache memory

Lab 3. Performance evaluation of pipelined processors

Lab 4. Nios II multiprocessor implementation, parallel programming, and performance evaluation

Lab 5. Nios II processor with customized architecture for a software application

Folder organization: <br />
./code: assembler and C programs <br />
./labs: pdf documents for hands-on exercises <br />
./SoC_configurations: binary files to configure the FPGA of a Terasic DE0-Nano board <br />
